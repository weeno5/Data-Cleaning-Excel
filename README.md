# Data-Cleaning-Excel

### This code is only for showcase and not for practical use

This code is for cleaning data in an excel file for a research project on student's mental health.
The Excel file is private.

The excel file had inconsistent data with varying strings that describes the same word.
For example, the data that describes the issue with a student may be "ANXIOUS", whereas in another row, another student has the issue "anxiety".
These two different words describe the same issue but the computer does not understand that.
To make meaningful calculations and analysis, we must clean the data first.
